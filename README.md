- I am currently working as project manager in the cybersecurity field.
- My objective is to build my technical skills to have a better understanding of all aspects of my projects.
- I am therefore following a series of courses and pursuing technical certifications.
- I use GitHub to store the Portfolio I am building by following these courses as well as personal projects.
